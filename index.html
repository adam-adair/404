    <pre>Hello Postman, welcome to your first day at the <strong>Axios Agency!</strong>

The Internet relies on us to fetch users the files they need, and we're relying on you!

Your task is to direct your dog Sparky to follow the correct routes to its destination.

You'll use your agency provided terminal to program Sparky, but be careful! You and Sparky will have to help each other pass authentication systems blocking both of your paths.

===================
Goal:

  - Meet Sparky at the end point (the purple node)

Instructions:

  - Use the arrow keys to move the Postman
  - Use the HUD to program up to 10 commands for Sparky to follow
  - Sparky can go forward, turn left or right, or begin a command loop
  - If there is no loop, Sparky will automatically repeat all his commands
  - To set Sparky on his route, press GO!
  - If you mess up, press RESET to try again

===================
We'll give you a simple assignment to start with so you can get the hang of it.

Dear Postman,

<strong>Congratulations!!</strong>

Thanks to you and faithful Sparky's tireless efforts, Axios Agency's routes have been restored!

Please accept this ASCII trophy as a token of our sincere appreciation for your service.
