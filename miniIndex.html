  Our users rely on us to fetch them the files they need, and we're relying on you!

  Your task is to direct your dog Sparky to follow the correct routes to its destination.

  You'll use your agency provided terminal to program Sparky, but be careful! You and Sparky will have to help each other pass authentication systems blocking both of your paths.

  ===================
  Goal:

    - Meet Sparky at the end point (the purple node)

  Instructions

    - Use the arrow keys to move the Postman
    - Use the HUD to program up to 10 moves for Sparky to follow
        (We'll let you find out what each one does on your own!)
    - To set Sparky on his route, press Go!
    - If you mess up, press Reset to try again

  ===================
  We'll give you a simple assignment to start with so you can get the hang of it.

  Dear Mr. Postman,

  <strong>Congratulations!!</strong>

  Thanks to you and faithful Sparky's tireless efforts, Axios Agency's routes have been restored!

  Please accept this ASCII trophy as a token of our sincere appreciation for your service.
